# FRC-Testing-Examples
Examples for testing (unit and integration) FRC Java code

I'm setting up the project today. Created the repo, and now following instructions here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/imaging-romi.html  

I have a Romi with an image on it, but I'm going to make sure I have the latest image and setup. I have downloaded and installed the Romi image WPILibPi_image-v2021.2.1-Romi.zip, which is what I downloaded and installed previously.  


I ended up re-imaging the Romi image; I couldn't connect to it. 

Now I'm setting up the WPILib Romi Project.  

Success! I can control the Romi with the simulation. So we're at the same place I was in February with the status.  

Now to add some testing elements.
